## About

This is a color theme for vs code in case the light mode is not enough for you. If you didn't guess it: It's a light theme.

## Install

You can install the extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=flashbang.flashbang) (maybe not the best idea)

> Make sure to know the keyboard shortcut for switching the color themes (usually `ctrl + k + ctrl + t` and `arrow up or down`). It could be hard to switch back to a normal theme without knowing the keyboard shortcut.
